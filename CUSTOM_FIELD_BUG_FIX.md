# Custom Field Bug Fix

## Problem Description

The `custom` field in the `packing_items` table was incorrectly showing `TRUE` for all items, even those generated by the AI. This field is meant to distinguish between:
- **AI-generated items** (`custom: false`) - Items suggested by ChatGPT/OpenAI
- **User-added items** (`custom: true`) - Items manually added by the user

## Root Cause

When AI-generated items were saved to the database, they went through the same POST endpoint (`/api/trips/[id]/items`) that was designed for user-added items. This endpoint always hardcoded `custom: true`, ignoring the original value from the AI.

### Bug Flow:
1. AI generates items with `custom: false` ✅ (correct)
2. `savePackingListToDatabase()` sends items to database but **omitted the `custom` field** ❌
3. POST `/api/trips/[id]/items` endpoint **always set `custom: true`** ❌
4. Result: All items in database marked as `custom: true` ❌

## Solution

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Frontend - Save AI-generated items with custom field
**File:** `src/app/packing-list/page.tsx`

Updated `savePackingListToDatabase()` to include the `custom` field when POSTing items:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  name: item.name,
  category: item.category,
  essential: item.essential,
  custom: item.custom, // ✅ Now preserves the value from AI
  quantity: 1,
}),
```

#### 2. Frontend - Explicitly mark user-added items
**File:** `src/app/packing-list/page.tsx`

Updated `addCustomItem()` to explicitly send `custom: true`:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  name: item.name,
  category: item.category,
  essential: item.essential,
  custom: true, // ✅ User-added items are explicitly marked
}),
```

#### 3. Backend - Accept custom field from request
**File:** `src/app/api/trips/[id]/items/route.ts`

Updated the POST endpoint to use the `custom` field from the request body:

```typescript
custom: body.custom !== undefined ? body.custom : true, // ✅ Use provided value, default to true
```

This respects the value sent from the frontend while maintaining backward compatibility (defaults to `true` if not provided).

#### 4. TypeScript Types - Add custom field
**File:** `src/types/index.ts`

Updated the `AddPackingItemRequest` interface:

```typescript
export interface AddPackingItemRequest {
  name: string
  category: PackingCategory
  essential: boolean
  custom?: boolean // ✅ Optional: defaults to true for user-added items, false for AI-generated items
  quantity?: number
  notes?: string
}
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ All items showed `custom: true` in database
- ❌ No way to distinguish AI suggestions from user additions
- ❌ Potential future features (like "reset to AI suggestions") wouldn't work

### After Fix:
- ✅ AI-generated items correctly saved as `custom: false`
- ✅ User-added items correctly saved as `custom: true`
- ✅ Enables future features like filtering, analytics, and AI suggestion resets
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Testing

No linter errors found in modified files:
- ✅ `src/app/packing-list/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/api/trips/[id]/items/route.ts`
- ✅ `src/types/index.ts`

## Database Migration Note

**Important:** Existing items in the database that were AI-generated but marked as `custom: true` will need to be manually corrected if distinction is important for your use case. You could:

1. Delete all existing packing items and regenerate them
2. Run a SQL update to set `custom: false` for items you know were AI-generated
3. Leave as-is (only new items will be correctly marked)

Example SQL to reset all items (use with caution):
```sql
-- This assumes you want to mark all existing items as AI-generated
UPDATE packing_items SET custom = false WHERE custom = true;
```

Or be more selective if you can identify patterns:
```sql
-- Mark items from specific trips as AI-generated
UPDATE packing_items 
SET custom = false 
WHERE trip_id IN (SELECT id FROM trips WHERE created_at >= '2025-11-01');
```
