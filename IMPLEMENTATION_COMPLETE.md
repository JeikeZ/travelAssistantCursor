# RLS Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

The application has been successfully updated to use **Row Level Security (RLS) with a service role key** for all backend operations. This fixes the security issue where all users could see trips created by other users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Server-Side Supabase Client
- **File**: `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`
- Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable
- Bypasses RLS policies (requires application-level security)
- Should ONLY be used in server-side code

### 2. Updated All API Routes to Use Server Client

All API routes have been migrated from the anonymous key client to the service role client:

#### Trips API Routes
- ✅ `/api/trips/route.ts` - Create and list trips
- ✅ `/api/trips/[id]/route.ts` - Get, update, delete specific trip
- ✅ `/api/trips/stats/route.ts` - Get trip statistics
- ✅ `/api/trips/[id]/duplicate/route.ts` - Duplicate trip
- ✅ `/api/trips/[id]/items/route.ts` - Add and list packing items
- ✅ `/api/trips/[id]/items/[itemId]/route.ts` - Update and delete packing items

#### Auth API Routes
- ✅ `/api/auth/login/route.ts` - User login
- ✅ `/api/auth/register/route.ts` - User registration
- ✅ `/api/auth/guest/route.ts` - Guest user creation

### 3. Created Setup Documentation
- **File**: `RLS_SETUP.md`
- Complete step-by-step instructions for configuring RLS in Supabase
- SQL commands to enable RLS and create security policies
- Troubleshooting guide

## Security Model

### Before
```
Client → Anon Key → Supabase Database
            ↓
    All data accessible (VULNERABLE) ❌
```

### After
```
Client → API Routes → Service Role Key → Supabase Database
                            ↓
                  Application-level security ✅
                  Filtering by user_id ✅

Client → Anon Key (Direct) → Supabase Database
                ↓
          Blocked by RLS ✅
```

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Service Role Key to Vercel ⚠️ REQUIRED

1. **Get Service Role Key from Supabase**
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project
   - Go to **Project Settings** → **API**
   - Copy the **`service_role`** key (keep this secret!)

2. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - Click **Add New**
   - Name: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Value: (paste your service role key)
   - Environment: Select **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Redeploy Your Application**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the three dots (•••) on the latest deployment
   - Click **Redeploy**
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Enable RLS in Supabase ⚠️ REQUIRED

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Click **SQL Editor** in the sidebar
   - Click **New Query**

2. **Run These SQL Commands**

```sql
-- ================================================
-- ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY ON ALL TABLES
-- ================================================

-- Enable RLS on trips table
ALTER TABLE trips ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on packing_items table
ALTER TABLE packing_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on users table
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;


-- ================================================
-- CREATE RESTRICTIVE RLS POLICIES
-- ================================================

-- Block all direct access to trips table
CREATE POLICY "Block direct access to trips"
  ON trips
  FOR ALL
  USING (false);

-- Block all direct access to packing_items table
CREATE POLICY "Block direct access to packing_items"
  ON packing_items
  FOR ALL
  USING (false);

-- Users can read own data only
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own data"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  USING (id::text = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub');

-- Allow user registration
CREATE POLICY "Allow user registration"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

3. **Click Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works ✓

1. **Test Your Application**
   - Visit your deployed application
   - Create a new account or login
   - Create some test trips
   - Verify trips appear correctly

2. **Test Security**
   - Create a second account (different username)
   - Login with the second account
   - Create different trips
   - **IMPORTANT**: Verify you CANNOT see trips from the first account
   - Each user should only see their own trips

3. **Check for Errors**
   - Monitor Vercel logs for any errors
   - Check browser console for frontend errors
   - If you see authentication errors, verify the service role key is set correctly

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Service role key added to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Application redeployed after adding environment variable
- [ ] SQL commands executed in Supabase to enable RLS
- [ ] RLS policies created successfully
- [ ] Tested with multiple user accounts
- [ ] Verified users cannot see each other's trips
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs or browser console

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable"
- Verify you added the environment variable to Vercel
- Make sure the variable name is exactly: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Redeploy your application after adding the variable

### Error: "Failed to create trip" or database operation errors
- Check Vercel logs for detailed error messages
- Verify the service role key is correct (copy it again from Supabase)
- Ensure RLS policies were created successfully

### Users can still see all trips
- Verify RLS is enabled on the `trips` table in Supabase
- Check that the restrictive policy was created: `Block direct access to trips`
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Test with an incognito/private window

### "new row violates row-level security policy" error
This means RLS is working! If you see this for legitimate operations:
- Ensure you redeployed with the service role key environment variable
- The service role key should bypass RLS policies
- Check Vercel logs to see which operation is failing

## Technical Details

### Why Service Role Key?
Since your application uses custom authentication (not Supabase Auth):
- Standard RLS policies using `auth.uid()` won't work
- Service role key bypasses RLS for backend operations
- Application code enforces security by filtering by `user_id`
- RLS prevents direct database access via the public anon key

### Security Best Practices
✅ **DO:**
- Keep service role key secret (never expose to client)
- Use environment variables for sensitive keys
- Enable RLS on all tables with user data
- Test with multiple accounts to verify isolation

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit service role key to version control
- Use service role key in client-side code
- Disable RLS in production
- Rely solely on application-level security

- [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables)
- See `RLS_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions

## Summary

✅ **Code changes**: Complete  
⚠️ **Vercel configuration**: Required (add service role key)  
⚠️ **Supabase configuration**: Required (enable RLS and create policies)  
✓ **Testing**: Required (verify with multiple accounts)

Once you complete Steps 1-3 above, your application will be secure and users will only see their own trips!
