## üìã Your Setup Tasks

### Step 1: Supabase Account Setup (2 minutes)

- [ ] Wait for project to finish provisioning (1-2 minutes)

### Step 3: Create Users Table (1 minute)

- [ ] In Supabase, click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
- [ ] Click "New Table" button
- [ ] Enter table name: `users`
- [ ] Disable "Enable Row Level Security (RLS)" checkbox (for now)
- [ ] Click "Save"
- [ ] Add column: `username`
  - [ ] Type: `text`
  - [ ] Check "Is Unique" ‚úì
  - [ ] Check "Is Nullable" = NO ‚úì

- [ ] Keep these values handy for next step

### Step 5: Configure Environment (1 minute)

- [ ] In your project root, create a new file named `.env.local`
- [ ] Copy this template into the file:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# OpenAI Configuration (if you have it)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
```

- [ ] Replace `your-project-url-here` with your Project URL from Step 4
- [ ] Replace `your-anon-key-here` with your anon public key from Step 4
- [ ] Save the file

### Step 6: Start Application (30 seconds)

- [ ] Open terminal in project directory
- [ ] Run: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Wait for "Ready" message
- [ ] Open browser to http://localhost:3000

### Step 7: Test Authentication (2 minutes)

#### Test Registration
- [ ] Modal should appear automatically
- [ ] Click "Create an account" at the bottom
- [ ] Enter a username (e.g., `testuser123`)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Missing Supabase environment variables"

**Problem:** Environment variables not found

**Solution:**
1. Verify `.env.local` exists in project root (not in `src/`)
2. Check variable names are exactly:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Stop server (Ctrl+C) and restart: `npm run dev`

### ‚ùå "Failed to create account"

**Problem:** Database connection issue

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Check project status is "Active" (green)
3. Verify `users` table exists
4. Check table has columns: `id`, `username`, `password`, `created_at`
5. Verify API keys are correct in `.env.local`

### ‚ùå Modal doesn't appear

**Problem:** UI rendering issue

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages in red
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Check terminal for server errors

### ‚ùå "Username already exists"

**Problem:** This is normal! Username is taken.

**Solution:**
- Try a different username, OR
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí users table
- Find and delete the existing user row
- Try again with same username
