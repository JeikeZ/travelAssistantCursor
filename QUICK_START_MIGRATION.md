## 🔴 ACTION REQUIRED - Database Migration

**You must complete this ONE step before deploying:**

### Add `password_hash_type` Column to Your Database

Choose **one** of these methods:

#### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest - 2 minutes)

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Database** → **Tables** → **users**
4. Click **+ New Column**
5. Configure:
   - **Name**: `password_hash_type`
   - **Type**: `text` (or `varchar`)
   - **Default value**: `base64`
   - **Is nullable**: No
6. Click **Save**
7. ✅ Done!

#### Method 2: SQL Editor (Copy & Paste - 1 minute)

1. Open your Supabase project
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **+ New query**
4. Paste this SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN password_hash_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'base64' NOT NULL;
```

5. Click **Run** (▶️)
6. ✅ Done!

## 🎯 What Happens After You Deploy

### ✨ New Users (Immediate Effect)
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (industry standard)
- ✅ Secure from day 1
- ✅ No configuration needed

### 🔄 Existing Users (Automatic & Transparent)
- ✅ Can log in normally with their current password
- ✅ Password automatically upgraded to bcrypt on successful login
- ✅ Zero user impact - completely seamless
- ✅ No action required from users

## 📊 Monitor Migration Progress

After deployment, run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to track progress:

```sql
SELECT 
  password_hash_type,
  COUNT(*) as users,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) as percent
FROM users
GROUP BY password_hash_type;
```

Example output:
```
password_hash_type | users | percent
-------------------|-------|--------
base64             |   750 |  75.0
bcrypt             |   250 |  25.0
```

Watch the bcrypt percentage grow as users log in!
